Phân biệt CAN, COULD và WOULD

1\. Asking people to do things (requests):

- We often use can or could to ask people to do something:

E.g:

Can you wait a moment, please? or Could you wait a moment, please?

Liz, can you do me a favour?

Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the station?

I wonder if you could help me.

- We also say "Do you think (you) could...?" (without using can):

E.g: Do you think you could lend me some money until next week?

- We can use will and would to ask people to do something:

Kate, will you do me a favor?

Would you please be quiet? I'm trying to concentrate.

2\. Asking for things.

To ask for something, you can say Can I have...? or Could I have...?

E.g:

(in a shop) Can I have these postcards, please?

(during a meal) Could I have salt, please?

You can use May I have...?

E.g:

May I have these postcards, please?

3\. Asking for and giving permission.

To ask for permission, we usually use can, could or may:

E.g:

(on the phone) Hello, can I speak to Tom, please?

"Could I use your phone?" "Yes, of course."

Do you think I could borrow your bike?

"May I come in?" "Yes, please do."

To give somebody permission to do something, we use can or may:

E.g: You can use the phone. or You may use the phone.

May is more formal and less used than can and could.

4\. Offering to do things.

E.g:

"Can I get you a cup of coffee?" "Yes, that would be very nice."

"Can I help you?" "No, it's all right. I can manage."

5\. Offering and inviting.

To offer something or invite somebody to do something, we use Would you like...? (not "do you like")

E.g:

"Would you like a cup of coffee?" "Yes, please."

"Would you like to come to dinner tomorrow evening?" "Yes, I'd love to."

I'd like... is a polite and formal way to show what we want.

E.g:

(at a tourist information office) I'd like some information about hotels, please.

(in a shop) I'd like to try on this jacket, please.
