Difference between "by myself" and "on my own"
"I learn to play baseball by myself."

"I learn to play baseball on my own."

Do they have same meaning?
If they don't, can someone explain their difference?


"On my own" connotes doing something without assistance from others.

"By myself" connotes doing something without the company of other people.

There are situations where one implies the other, of course, but for example, I might "live on my own" meaning I am not being financially supported by my parents any more, but I have roommates, so I am not living "by myself." Conversely, if I were to get a studio apartment and live alone, I would be living "by myself," but I could only afford to do so with my family's assistance, so I would not be living "on my own."
